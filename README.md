# POLMM
Proportional Odds Logistic Mixed Model (POLMM) for ordinal categorical data analysis

# Note
Currently, the package is still under fast development. If you are interested, please refer to POLMM_working repository for the most updated version. Hopefully, I can recently finish a version (should be 0.2.0) with more comprehensive testing and a complete manual. At that time, I will move to this repository. If you find some trouble using the current version, please contact me (wenjianb@umich.edu) and I would send you a notice when that version is completed and uploaded.
